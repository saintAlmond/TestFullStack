# Test Full-Stack Tappx -- Isa Almena

A simple app crud made with React.js (Front-End) and Laravel (Back-End) with DDBB (MySQL).

## Installation
It is important that after download install composer

```bash
composer install
```
install React.js
```bash
npm install
```

## The concept of the test

Create a crud with two fields "name" and “Bundle.
A valid name value should be at least 4 characters long and it should only contain letters, numbers,spaces and/or ‘-‘ and ‘_’ character. It should at least contain 2 letter or numbers.
The part where I put the bundle values I couldn't put them because I had a lot of understanding problems.
